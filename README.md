# MIT 6.00.2x Study Solo Project 
### A repo made to record and display all work for MIT's 6.00.2x assignments and work.

### Things learned:
* Using ternary digits to find unique combinations of putting items in two bags (**Knapsack problem**)
* Working with graph theory and nodes to assess weighted edges using DFS/BFS algorithms
* Tinkering with Tkinter (get it?)

### Overall, a productive project that enabled me to enhance my coding logic specifically in Python.

## Preview of work done:

## Key Notes:
* This will require Tkinter for certain parts of the project (make sure your Python is up to date)
* Matplotlib as well if you want to see certain graphs.

## To recreate this on your own machine:

### In console:
`
npm install tkinter
`
`
npm install matplotlib
`

### Add these lines at the start of your Python file:
```
from tkinter import *
from tkinter import ttk
```
```
import pylab as plt
* the rest is depending on the graph you decide to do
```

### Choose any example code from the Docs here and adjust to the best fit.
