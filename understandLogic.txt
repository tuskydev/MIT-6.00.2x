In a list of any kind there are 2^n permutations possible.

- In the example of a list such as: [a, b, c, d]
- There are 2^4 possible permutations (16)

Lets draw these out to have a clearer picture.

0 decimal is 000 binary - no items chosen, []
1 decimal is 001 binary - ['c']
2 decimal is 010 binary - ['b']
3 decimal is 011 binary - ['b', 'c']
4 decimal is 100 binary - ['a']
5 decimal is 101 binary - ['a', 'c']
6 decimal is 110 binary - ['a', 'b']
7 decimal is 111 binary - ['a', 'b', 'c']

8 decimal is 1000 binary - ['a']
9 decimal is 1001 binary - ['a','d']
10 decimal is 1010 binary - ['a', 'c']
11 decimal is 1011 binary - ['a', 'c', 'd']
12 decimal is 1100 binary - ['a', 'b']
13 decimal is 1101 binary - ['a', 'b', 'd']
14 decimal is 1110 binary - ['a', 'b', 'c']
15 decimal is 1111 binary - ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

Possible permutations in 2 bags:
- We know that for one bag it's 2^n

[], []
['a'], []
[], ['a']
['b'], []
[], ['b']
['a'], ['b']
['b'], ['a']
['b', 'a'], []
[], ['b', 'a']

My guess is the formula for two bags is: 2(2^n)+1
WRONG (ðŸ˜­): Answer is: 3^n
